 Fake Profile Detection using Machine Learning and NLP
📌 Overview
With the surge in online social media usage, fake profiles have become a significant concern. These profiles can spread misinformation, perform scams, and manipulate public opinion. This project presents a machine learning-based system to detect fake social media profiles using user data attributes such as followers, following, posts, and profile completeness.

🎯 Objectives
Develop a supervised machine learning model to classify profiles as real or fake.

Engineer features that best capture suspicious behaviors.

Build a user-friendly web interface for real-time profile testing.

Evaluate model performance on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
